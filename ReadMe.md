# Friend Finder App

### Overview
This application takes in user inputs (via a 10 question survey) and finds their friend match by compatring their survey results with our database of other's survey results. It then displays their closest match in a modul (name and image). As more users use the application their will be a bigger variety of possible friend matches.

### Technology Used
  * Node.js and Express.js (for the routing and data storage)
  * HTML, CSS (including Bootstrap and Font Awesome Icons)
  * GitHub (repository)
  * Heroku (deployment/hosting)
