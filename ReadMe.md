# Friend Finder App

### Overview

This application takes in user inputs (via  10 question survey) and finds their friend match by compating their survey results with our database of survey results. It then displays their closest match in a modul (name and image). As more users use the application their will be a bigger variety of possible friend matches.

### Technology Used
  * Node.js and Express.js (for the routing and data storage)
  * HTML, CSS (including Bootstrap and Font Awesome)
  * GitHub (repository)
  * Heroku (deployment/hosting)
